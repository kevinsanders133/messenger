## Back-end
Microservices are written in JavaScript on the Node.js platform. I used the Express framework and socket.io library. All microservices are dockerized. 
To create and orchestrate the containers, I used the docker-compose.yml file in which all microservices settings and dependencies are defined. 
I used a reverse proxy in the form of Nginx.
User and chat's data is collected in MongoDB Atlas.
